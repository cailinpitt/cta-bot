## What it posts

> Each major feature has a deep-dive in [`docs/`](docs/): [bunching](docs/BUNCHING.md), [gaps](docs/GAPS.md), [ghosting](docs/GHOSTING.md), [speedmaps](docs/SPEEDMAP.md), [alerts + pulse](docs/ALERTS.md).

### Bus (`@ctabusinsights`)
- **Bunching** — clusters of buses on the same route/direction, as an annotated map. Reply includes a ~10-minute timelapse video of the cluster, with traffic signals annotated.
- **Gaps** — long stretches with no bus service, compared against the scheduled headway from GTFS.
- **Speedmap** — a bus route color-coded by observed speed over a 1-hour window.
- **Heatmap** — weekly/monthly rollup of chronic bunching + gap stops, plotted across Chicago.
- **Ghost buses** — hourly rollup of routes with materially fewer active buses than the schedule implies.

### Train (`@ctatraininsights`)
- **Bunching** — clusters (2+) of L trains running too close together, with map + timelapse reply.
- **Gaps** — long stretches with no L service on a given line/direction, using the GTFS rail schedule.
- **Speedmap** — an L line color-coded by observed train speed, with a separate ribbon per direction. For Purple, truncates to the shuttle segment outside express hours.
- **Heatmap** — weekly/monthly rollup of chronic bunching + gap stations, with a Loop inset since five lines share the elevated rectangle.
- **Snapshot** — 15-minute timelapse of every active train system-wide, with a Loop inset.
- **Ghost trains** — hourly rollup of line/direction pairs missing trains vs. the schedule.

### Alerts (`@ctaalertinsights`)
- **Republished CTA alerts** — significant service alerts on tracked routes, filtered to drop the noisy "major" ones (single elevator out, block-party reroutes, etc.). Each post gets a threaded `✅ cleared` reply once CTA marks it resolved.
- **Segment-dim maps** — when a rail alert names a station-to-station stretch ("between Belmont and Howard"), the post includes a map dimming that segment of the line.
- **Pulse** — a bot-side detector that infers a rail service suspension from live train positions when a ≥2-mile stretch of a line goes cold for 15+ min. Often surfaces outages before CTA issues an alert; threaded under the official alert when one appears.

### Both bus and train
- **Historical callouts** — posts carry frequency and severity context from prior posts in `history.sqlite`, e.g. *"3rd Route 66 bunch reported today"* or *"tightest reported on this line in 30 days"*.

The bus bot tracks a subset of CTA routes — see `src/bus/routes.js`. The train bot covers all 8 L lines.

## Setup

1. **Clone and install**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cailinpitt/cta-insights.git
   cd cta-insights
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install `ffmpeg`** — required for bunching timelapse replies.
   ```
   brew install ffmpeg    # macOS
   apt install ffmpeg     # Debian/Ubuntu
   ```

3. **Create `.env`** — `cp .env.example .env` and fill in:

   | Var | What it's for | Where to get it |
   |---|---|---|
   | `CTA_TRAIN_KEY` | CTA Train Tracker API key | [transitchicago.com/developers](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/) |
   | `CTA_BUS_KEY` | CTA Bus Tracker API key | same |
   | `MAPBOX_TOKEN` | Mapbox Static Images API | [account.mapbox.com](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/) |
   | `BLUESKY_SERVICE` | Bluesky PDS URL | defaults to `https://bsky.social` |
   | `BLUESKY_BUS_IDENTIFIER` | Bus bot handle or DID | your Bluesky account |
   | `BLUESKY_BUS_APP_PASSWORD` | Bus bot app password | bsky.app → Settings → App Passwords |
   | `BLUESKY_TRAIN_IDENTIFIER` | Train bot handle or DID | same |
   | `BLUESKY_TRAIN_APP_PASSWORD` | Train bot app password | same |
   | `BLUESKY_ALERTS_IDENTIFIER` | Alerts bot handle or DID | same |
   | `BLUESKY_ALERTS_APP_PASSWORD` | Alerts bot app password | same |

4. **Build the GTFS index** — required before any gap or ghost detection runs.
   ```
   npm run fetch-gtfs
   ```

5. **Fetch traffic signals** — optional, one-time. Annotates bus bunching timelapse videos with intersection signals.
   ```
   npm run fetch-signals
   ```

6. **Smoke test** — loads every bin file with `--check`.
   ```
   npm run smoke
   ```

7. **Try a dry run** — writes an image under `assets/`, does not post.
   ```
   npm run bunching:dry
   ```

## Running it

Everything is designed to be driven by cron. There's no long-running process — each script does one detection or rollup and exits. The full schedule lives in [`cron/crontab.txt`](cron/crontab.txt) and can be installed with `crontab cron/crontab.txt` (or merged into an existing crontab between the `# CTA-BOT-START` / `# CTA-BOT-END` markers to preserve unrelated jobs).

Each line uses [`bin/cron-run.sh`](bin/cron-run.sh) — a small wrapper that handles `cd` to the repo root, timestamps each invocation, and redirects stdout/stderr to `cron/<log-name>-cron.log`. So a job entry is just:

```cron
*/10 * * * * /home/you/cta-insights/bin/cron-run.sh train-bunching bin/train/bunching.js
```

instead of repeating the boilerplate on every line. The snapshot timelapse runs in-process for ~15 minutes per invocation, so it's scheduled every 3 hours; everything else is fast and runs on its own cadence.

## Scripts reference

All bin scripts accept `--dry-run` (writes image under `assets/` instead of posting). Recap scripts additionally accept `--window week|month` (default `month`).

### Observers / maintenance
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run observe-buses` | Bus observer — fetches every active CTA route and records positions (no posting). Run every 10 min. |
| `npm run fetch-gtfs` | Rebuild `data/gtfs/index.json`. Run daily. |
| `npm run fetch-signals` | Rebuild `data/signals/chicago.json` from OpenStreetMap. Run monthly. |

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Run the test suite (`node --test`). |
| `npm run smoke` | Load each bin with `--check` — fast sanity check after edits. |

| `npm run lint` | Report Biome lint warnings (no changes written). |
| `npm run check` | Format + apply safe lint fixes across the whole repo. |

Formatting + safe lint fixes run automatically on `git commit` via a husky pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit` → `lint-staged` → `biome check --write` on staged `*.{js,json}` files only). Config lives in `biome.json`. After cloning, `npm install` runs `prepare` which installs the hook for you.

## How it works

Each major feature has a deep-dive doc in [`docs/`](docs/):
- [BUNCHING.md](docs/BUNCHING.md) — cluster detection for buses and trains
- [GAPS.md](docs/GAPS.md) — long-gap detection vs. scheduled headway
- [GHOSTING.md](docs/GHOSTING.md) — hourly missing-vehicle detection
- [SPEEDMAP.md](docs/SPEEDMAP.md) — colored route speed maps
- [ALERTS.md](docs/ALERTS.md) — CTA service alert republishing


### Data sources
- **CTA Bus Tracker** and **CTA Train Tracker** APIs — live vehicle positions, polled by each script for its detection window.
- **GTFS static feed** — the scheduled baseline for gap and ghost detection. Rebuilt daily from the CTA's published bundle into `data/gtfs/index.json`, a compact `(route/line, direction, day_type, hour) → { median headway, median trip duration }` lookup.
- **OpenStreetMap (Overpass)** — traffic signal nodes inside a Chicago bounding box, used to annotate bus bunching timelapses. Rebuilt monthly.
- **Mapbox Static Images API** — base maps for every rendered image.

### Observation flow
Every call to `getVehicles` (bus) and `getAllTrainPositions` (train) writes a row to the `observations` table in `history.sqlite`. That means *every* job — bunching, gaps, speedmaps, snapshots — contributes data that ghost detection later consumes.

Bus routes not touched by bunching or gaps need an explicit observer run to show up in the ghost rollups and bus pulse detection. `scripts/observeBuses.js` handles that, fetching every active CTA route on a fixed ~10-min cadence. Bunching, gaps, and pulse all read the resulting snapshot via `getVehiclesCachedOrFresh` (11-min cache window) so the observer is the only API call site for the all-routes workload — that keeps the bus tracker under its 100k-call/month quota. Trains don't need a dedicated observer — one API call returns all 8 lines and other jobs hit the API often enough.

### History DB and callouts
`state/history.sqlite` records every detection (posted or cooldown-suppressed) and every observation. Retention is 90 days. Two things feed off it:
- **Cooldown** — posts for the same route/direction inside a short window are suppressed to avoid spam. Tracked in `state/posted.json`.
- **Callouts** — each post is annotated with frequency and severity from prior records, e.g. *"3rd Route 66 bunch reported today"* or *"largest gap reported on this line in 30 days"*.

SQLite runs in **WAL mode**. If you inspect `history.sqlite` with a CLI while jobs are running, recent rows may still live in `history.sqlite-wal` until checkpoint.

### Ghost detection math
```
expected_active = trip_duration / headway
missing = expected_active − observed_active
```
`observed_active` is the median distinct-vehicle count per polling snapshot over the past hour. A ghost event requires **both**:
- `missing / expected_active` ≥ 25%, **and**
- `missing` ≥ 3 vehicles in absolute terms.

The absolute floor keeps single-vehicle routes (where a 1-bus gap is 50% of expected) from producing hair-trigger posts.

### GTFS freshness gates
`loadIndex()` checks the age of `data/gtfs/index.json`:
- **> 2 days old** — warns on stderr.
- **> 7 days old** — throws.

Because the index honors `calendar_dates.txt`, a stale index misreports holiday/special-service days. The fatal threshold makes a missed cron loud rather than silently reporting against the wrong schedule.

### Purple line (speedmap quirk)
Purple runs Linden↔Loop express during weekday rush, Linden↔Howard shuttle otherwise. The speedmap reads the scheduled trip duration from the GTFS index — a ~95-min trip means express is running, a ~14-min trip means shuttle, and the polyline is truncated at Howard when the window is shuttle-only.

## State and storage

Local state (gitignored, operator-managed):

| Path | Purpose | Rebuilt by |
|---|---|---|
| `state/posted.json` | Cooldown keys + timestamps | each posting job |
| `state/history.sqlite` | Detections + observations, 90-day window | each posting + observer job |
| `data/gtfs/index.json` | Schedule lookup | `npm run fetch-gtfs` (daily) |
| `data/signals/chicago.json` | OSM traffic signals | `npm run fetch-signals` (monthly) |
| `data/patterns/*.json` | Cached bus route patterns (7-day TTL) | populated on demand |
