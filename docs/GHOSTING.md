# Ghost detection

How the bot decides that buses or trains are "missing" — running below the schedule the CTA publishes — and posts about it.

## What "ghosting" means

A **ghost** is the difference between the service the CTA promises and what's actually on the street or rails. If the schedule says nine trains should be running toward 95th/Dan Ryan right now and we only see five, there are four ghost trains.

The bot only posts when the gap is large enough and consistent enough that it almost certainly reflects a real service problem — not a momentary blip in the data feed.

> **Metra's analog of a ghost is a cancellation.** Because Metra is timetabled and its GTFS-realtime feed binds each scheduled `trip_id` to live status, the bot doesn't reconstruct "how many should be running" statistically — it knows exactly which scheduled train is missing. A trip flagged `CANCELED` (confirmed) or one that departed with no train ever seen (inferred) is the Metra ghost. See `docs/METRA.md` (Phase 2 — cancellations); the posting model is an hourly per-line rollup, like the CTA ghost rollups.

## The plain-English version

Once an hour, for each route or train line, the bot asks two questions:

1. **How many vehicles *should* be running right now?** Pulled from the CTA's published GTFS schedule.
2. **How many vehicles are we actually seeing?** Pulled from CTA's live vehicle-position feed, sampled every ten minutes for the past hour.

If "actually seeing" is meaningfully smaller than "should be running" — and stays that way across the whole hour — the bot posts.

The post looks like this:

> 🚌 Route 94 (California) NB · 3 of 7 missing (43%) · every ~28 min instead of ~16

That's saying: California buses going north should be coming every 16 minutes; they're effectively coming every 28 because three of the seven that should be on the road aren't (16 × 7⁄4).

## The technical version

### Step 1 — building the expected-service index

Once a day, `scripts/fetch-gtfs.js` downloads the full GTFS feed and builds a small JSON index at `data/gtfs/index.json`. A `service_id` is assigned to a day-type bucket by whether it actually runs on that bucket's **representative date** near the build (today for the matching day-type, this week's Sat/Sun, or the prior Friday for `weekday` on a weekend build) — via its `calendar.txt` day-of-week flags and date range plus `calendar_dates.txt` overrides. A service that straddles the boundary (a Tue–Sat owl) lands in every bucket it serves rather than being dropped, which is what the old "must be exactly Mon–Fri / Sat / Sun" rule did to single-day trippers, Friday-only trips, and late-night service coded Tue–Sat.

For every (route, direction, hour-of-day, day-type) bucket the index records:

- **Headway** — the spacing a rider actually experiences that hour: for a uniformly-random arrival minute, twice the mean wait until the next scheduled departure (an occupancy-weighted headway, not a median of trip-start gaps — which under-reads a schedule that clusters departures then goes quiet). Capped at 90 min. Display only.
- **Duration** — median end-to-end run time. Display only.
- **Active trips** — the *mean number of trips simultaneously in progress* during that hour. This is the ground truth we compare against.

The active-trip count is computed as an area under the curve. For each scheduled trip we know its departure and arrival times. For each hour the trip overlaps, we add the fraction of that hour the trip was in progress:

```
active_in_hour_H += (min(arrival, H_end) - max(departure, H_start)) / 3600
```

A 90-minute trip that runs 16:30–18:00 contributes 0.5 to hour 16, 1.0 to hour 17, and 0 to hour 18. Summed across all scheduled trips, this gives the mean number of vehicles that should be simultaneously running, hour by hour. It's the apples-to-apples comparison for snapshot counts of live vehicles.

Unlike the active-trip count, **headway is filtered**: measured per pattern (origin→dest terminal pair) with a dominant-`service_id`-per-hour filter, patterns below `MIN_PATTERN_TRIPS` (garage pull-outs, deadheads, one-offs) dropped, and schedule-identical duplicate trips across service families collapsed. The direction-level headway is then computed over the *merged* departure list of all the kept patterns, so a route that alternates patterns by time of day (Route 79 WB has a different pattern fill 6:39–7:46) doesn't read "every 40 min" at rush from one pattern's schedule-window hole. Active-trip counts do none of this — every revenue trip counts regardless of terminal or how minor its pattern, because for "how many buses should be on the street right now" it all counts. Earlier the active counter inherited the headway filters and chronically underestimated multi-terminal routes (e.g. Route 79 EB at 4 PM read as 6 expected when ~17 were observed); splitting the active loop out fixed this.

(An even earlier version used `duration / headway` as a stand-in for active trips. That works at steady state but breaks during ramp-up/ramp-down hours, where headway is computed from a handful of clustered trip-starts and the formula overestimates by 3-5×. Switching to the area-under-curve definition eliminated a class of false-positive "ghost" calls during morning service start.)

### Step 2 — observing live service

Two scripts feed a SQLite observations table:

- `scripts/observeBuses.js` — runs every ten minutes, fetches every active vehicle on every active CTA bus route. Bunching, gaps, and pulse all read this snapshot via the cache layer, so this script is the only API call site for the all-routes workload.
- The bunching/gap detectors also write every vehicle they see into the same table (so we get extra coverage for free).

Each row records `(ts, route, direction, vehicle_id, ...)`. Observations older than 7 days are rolled off; the live ghost detectors only look back one hour.

### Step 3 — detecting ghosts

`bin/bus/ghosts.js` and `bin/train/ghosts.js` run hourly (`:07` and `:08` past the hour) and call into `src/bus/ghosts.js` / `src/train/ghosts.js`. The core logic:

1. Pull the last hour of observations for each route/direction.
2. Group observations into per-timestamp snapshots and count distinct vehicles in each snapshot.
3. Take the median of those snapshot counts → `observedActive`.
4. Look up `expectedActive` from the index, using the **midpoint of the observation window** for the time of day — not "now". The cron fires at :07, so the hour-long window covers 53 minutes of the previous wall-clock hour and only 7 minutes of the current one. Looking up "now" mis-bucketed schedule transitions and produced spurious ghosts at e.g. AM rush ramp-up boundaries.
5. Compute `missing = expectedActive - observedActive`. If it clears all the gates below, emit an event.

### Step 4 — gates against false positives

False-positive ghost posts are a credibility risk; the gates exist to swallow ambiguous cases rather than over-call. From `src/bus/ghosts.js`:

| Gate | Threshold | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `MISSING_PCT_THRESHOLD` | ≥25% | The deficit must be a real share of expected service, not 1 of 8. |
| `MISSING_ABS_THRESHOLD` | ≥3 vehicles | Avoids firing on routes with tiny absolute counts. |
| `MIN_SNAPSHOTS` | ≥4 | At the 1-min observer cadence the hour-long window holds ~60 snapshots; 4 is a floor that tolerates a sustained outage and still requires real evidence before calling a ghost. |
| `MIN_OBSERVED` | ≥2 | "Missing 7 of 9" with observed 0 or 1 is either a genuine outage (the gap detector handles those) or a feed bug. |
| `active < 2` floor | skip | Routes with fewer than 2 expected vehicles are too sparse for a meaningful ghost call. |
| `MAX_EXPECTED_ACTIVE` | ≤30 | Sanity ceiling. >30 has historically meant a bad GTFS bucket; we'd rather skip than post nonsense. |
| Stddev gate | `stddev ≤ observedActive` | If per-snapshot counts swing wildly, that's almost always observer/polling instability, not actually-missing vehicles. |
| Ramp-fill gate | tail-25% median ≥ 80% × expected | If the *end* of the window already shows healthy service, the deficit is at the front of the hour (service ramping up), not now. Real outages persist into the tail. |

Train detection (`src/train/ghosts.js`) mirrors this exactly, with two extra wrinkles:

- **Loop lines** (Brown / Orange / Pink / Purple / Yellow) report a single GTFS direction for the full round trip. We aggregate line-wide rather than per-direction so the expected count isn't artificially halved.
- **Short-turns** (e.g. Blue Line UIC-Halsted) are filtered out: a destination is only used if it resolves to a true terminal station. Mid-route destinations don't have a clean terminal-to-terminal headway and can't be looked up reliably.

### Step 5 — posting

If any events survive the gates, they're sorted by `missing` descending and rendered into a single Bluesky post, one line each:

> 🚌 Route 94 (California) NB · 3 of 7 missing (43%) · every ~28 min instead of ~16

**How the headway is computed (`describeGhost`, `src/shared/ghostFormat.js`).** The headway shown is *effective* — the scheduled headway scaled up by how much service is missing. The model: the number of buses simultaneously on a route ≈ trip duration ÷ headway, so active count is inversely proportional to headway. Invert it and the effective headway is just the scheduled headway × (expected ÷ still-running):

```
effective headway = scheduled headway × expectedShown / (expectedShown − missingShown)
```

So "3 of 7 missing" on a 16-min route → 16 × 7/4 = **~28 min**. Two deliberate properties:

- **Counts and headway are derived from the same rounded integers.** Earlier the percentage came from rounded counts but the headway from the *raw* fractional ratio, so "4 of 9 missing" could print "~16" when 4-of-9 actually implies ~18. Now both come from the displayed `X of Y`, so they always agree and the number is reproducible by a reader.
- **The effective headway is floored at the scheduled headway.** A route that's missing buses is never reported as running *better* than its schedule (a rounding artifact that could otherwise show "every ~9 instead of ~10").

When the deficit is so large the estimate explodes (>3× scheduled), we fall back to "scheduled every ~X min" rather than claim a misleadingly precise number.

**What counts as "still running" (bus only).** The displayed count isn't the raw full-hour observed count — it's measured two ways to stay honest about *current* conditions:

- **Parked/dead buses are excluded.** A bus that's barely moved over the last ~5 minutes (the same confirmed-parked test `bunching.js` uses) isn't providing service, so it doesn't count toward "still running" — otherwise a laid-over or dead bus broadcasting on the route makes the gap read better than the street feels.
- **The recent window, not the whole hour.** The displayed service level uses the tail (most recent ~25%) of the window, so a *worsening* outage reads as bad as it currently is rather than being averaged against the healthier start of the hour.

This is display only: the **firing decision** (Step 3–4) still uses the robust full-hour median observed count, so what gets *posted* doesn't change, only how the line reads. Trains have no `pdist`, so the parked/recent-window refinement is bus-only — train lines use the same `describeGhost` math on their full-window observed count.

A note on what the number does and doesn't capture: it's a *mean* headway — total time ÷ buses. It does not model bunching (if the surviving buses clump together, the mean gap is unchanged but riders in the resulting hole wait longer than the mean implies). That's a deliberate choice: a mean is route-agnostic and makes no assumption about when riders arrive.

If no events clear the gates, the bot stays silent. Silence is the correct answer most hours.

## Why this approach

The CTA publishes a schedule. Live vehicle positions are public. The interesting signal isn't either feed alone — it's the gap between them, sustained over a window long enough to rule out polling noise. That's a genuinely simple idea; almost everything in the code above is in service of *not* crying wolf.

## Trailing-tail override

Whole-hour `MISSING_ABS_THRESHOLD = 3` is the right floor for steady deficits but over-rejects mid-incident drops with less evidence accumulated. The override admits at `missing ≥ 2` when:

- `tailMedian < observedActive` (deficit concentrated in the last 25% of the window).
- `trailingDeficit ≥ 2`.

Steady whole-window under-counts of 2 still drop. The train ghost cron also writes near-miss `meta_signals` rows (severity ≥ 0.5) for sub-threshold drops, plus full-strength rows for posted events — `bin/incident-roundup.js` reads these for cross-detector correlation.
